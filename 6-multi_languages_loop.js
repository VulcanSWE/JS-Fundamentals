//A script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

myArray = ["C is fun", "Python is cool", "JavaScript is amazing"];

for (let i=0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}
// The code iterates through an array of strings and logs each string to the console
// It uses a for loop to access each element of the array and print it
